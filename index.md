title: NJOYâ€”Nuclear Data Processing Code
---

This is the home page for NJOY, the nuclear data processing code developed at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://www.lanl.gov).

Two versions of NJOY are currently managed and distributed from this website:

 - [NJOY21](https://njoy.github.io/NJOY21) A new version---written in C++---and backwards compatible with NJOY2016. NJOY21 is the future of NJOY and is where all development is currently being done.
   `LA-CC-15-092`
 - [NJOY2016](https://njoy.github.io/NJOY2016) The legacy Fortran version that is familiar to long-time NJOY users. **NJOY2016 is deprecated.** No active development is being done on NJOY2016, only bug fixes.
   `LA-CC-16-075`

## Open Source Availability
For the first time, NJOY is freely available under the BSD 3-clause license. Both NJOY2016 and NJOY21 are **free to use**, but the copyright and license must remain with the code.

### Getting NJOY
Instructions for obtaining, compiling, and testing NJOY can be found [here](Build/).

## Support or Contact
Technical support for both versions of NJOY can be obtained with an email to: [njoy@lanl.gov](mailto:njoy@lanl.gov). NJOY developers are also found lurking in the [NJOY-help](https://gitter.im/njoy/NJOY-help) chat room. Come visit if you have any questions.
